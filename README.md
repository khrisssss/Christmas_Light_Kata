## 
I did use few chatgpt to understand the code (what a shame) I did lot of error doing it alone
I used VS Code,  Linux Terminal and Github


## HOw to Run ( I do use Linux so this is what I put on the terminal to open the file from VS Code to terminal)

```bash
cd ~/christmas_lights_kata 
then run the code
python3 xmas_kata_made_by_me.py
